Please try to provide the following:

- steps to reproduce and/or logging of the error
- version of forked-daapd
- platform

Steps to reproduce will greatly improve the chance of getting it fixed. If it is not possible then set the log level to debug (in /etc/forked-daapd.conf) and try to get some logging of when the error happens. Donâ€™t cut and paste lengthy log outtakes here on github. Instead, attach the log file.
